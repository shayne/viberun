# viberun (packaging placeholder)

This README is a placeholder used during packaging. The published PyPI package uses the
repository root README instead: `tools/packaging/build-pypi.sh` copies `README.md` into
`dist/pypi-src/` before building the sdist/wheel.

If you want a custom PyPI README in the future, update this file and the build script.
