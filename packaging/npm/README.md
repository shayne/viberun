# viberun (packaging placeholder)

This README is a placeholder used during packaging. The published npm package uses the
repository root README instead: `tools/packaging/build-npm.sh` copies `README.md` into
`dist/npm/` before `npm publish`.

If you want a custom npm README in the future, update this file and the build script.
