# .mise.toml - per-app tool versions and tasks for this container.
# Use: mise install (installs tools), mise run <task> (runs tasks).

[env]
# Example environment variables for tasks.
# APP_ENV = "development"

[tools]
# Pin tool versions. Examples:
# node = "24"
# python = "3.12"
# go = "1.23"
# rust = "1.83"
# Note: the assistant’s knowledge cutoff is 2024. Verify “latest” versions
# before pinning with `mise ls-remote <tool>` (and/or `brew info <formula>`).

[tasks]
# Tasks are shell commands. Examples:
# dev = "npm run dev"
# test = "pytest -q"
# lint = "npm run lint"
